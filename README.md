# DB-Visual-Hackathon

# Overview - Solution to Prompt 2

## Tools Used

Participants are encouraged to use the following tools:
- Streamlit
- Python
- APIs for data

## Prompt 2: Visualization of Financial Statement

Quarterly financial data on publicly traded companies can take a long time to manually retrieve (especially for long stretches of time). Financial statements can also be very dense. Since they are packed with a lot of information, we want to narrow down the visualization to a few key-metrics. If we input a company ticker, we should be able to retrieve quarterly data from the following-key-metrics: 
  1. Company's name
  2. Company's mission statement (if available)
  3. Qualitative description of what the company does
  4. Revenue Per Share
  5. Net Income Per Share
  6. Free Cash Flow Per Share
  7. Tangible Book Value Per Share


### Visualization of Financial Statement

**Objective:** Create a visualization tool for key financial metrics of publicly traded companies.

**Key Features:**
- Retrieve quarterly financial data based on company ticker
- Display the following key metrics:
  1. Company's name
  2. Company's mission statement (if available)
  3. Qualitative description of what the company does
  4. Revenue Per Share
  5. Net Income Per Share
  6. Free Cash Flow Per Share
  7. Tangible Book Value Per Share

## Instructions

The objective of this hackathon is to create at minimum a proof of concept (POC), or at best a working Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for your team's selected prompt. Teams can utilize datasets from any open-source platform with the challenge to present a detailed outline of your concept or testable model aligning to your chosen prompt.

## Hackathon Rubric

1. **Prompt Accuracy:** Alignment to Prompt Guidelines
2. **Presentation:** Oral Delivery
3. **Originality:** "Outside the box" thinking for concepts, design, and name
4. **Technical Acumen:** SDLC principles, code maintainability, and use of right technology for the appropriate application
5. **Usability:** Augmented for future use, Accessibility, Exhibits concepts DB values

## SDLC Principles:

- Follow Agile methodologies for iterative development
- Implement version control using Git
- Conduct regular code reviews
- Practice continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability
- Implement error handling and logging
- Ensure scalability and performance optimization

## Best Practices:

### Documentation:
- Maintain clear and up-to-date README files
- Use inline comments for complex code sections
- Generate API documentation using tools like Sphinx or Doxygen
- Create user guides and technical documentation
- Document design decisions and architecture

### Unit Testing:
- Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Aim for high test coverage (e.g., 80% or higher)
- Use testing frameworks like pytest for Python
- Implement mock objects and fixtures for isolated testing
- Run tests automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline

### GitHub Actions:
- Set up automated workflows for CI/CD
- Configure linting and code style checks
- Automate unit test execution on pull requests
- Implement security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Set up automatic deployment to staging/production environments

## Contributing:

- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
- Follow the coding style and conventions used in the project
- Write clear commit messages and keep commits atomic
- Create a pull request with a detailed description of your changes
- Ensure all tests pass and add new tests if necessary
- Respond to code review comments and make requested changes
